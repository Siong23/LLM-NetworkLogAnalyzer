# 🤖 LLM-NetworkLogAnalyzer

**LLM-NetworkLogAnalyzer** is an AI-powered tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze, summarize, and classify network logs. It aims to assist network administrators and security analysts in making sense of complex and voluminous logs from firewalls, routers, 5G cores, and cloud infrastructure.

---

## 📌 Overview

Network environments generate massive amounts of log data that are difficult to parse manually. LLM-NetworkLogAnalyzer:
- Uses transformer-based models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, Mistral) to interpret unstructured or semi-structured logs
- Detects anomalies, highlights critical events, and explains patterns in natural language
- Helps automate root cause analysis and event summarization

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 **Log Parsing & Normalization**: Converts raw logs into structured formats (JSON, CSV)
- 🧾 **LLM-Powered Summarization**: Produces human-readable summaries of long log traces
- 🚨 **Anomaly Classification**: Uses fine-tuned models to detect and label suspicious events
- 📊 **Insight Generation**: Suggests actions based on recognized patterns
- 🧪 **Prompt Engineering Toolkit**: Supports custom log prompts and tuning
