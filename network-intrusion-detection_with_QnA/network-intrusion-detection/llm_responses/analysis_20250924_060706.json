  "full_response": "Alright, let's break down what I have here. The user has provided some network flow information and historical threat analysis context. My task is to analyze the network flow and provide a comprehensive threat assessment in JSON format.\n\nFirst, looking at the flow info: source and destination are both 0, which usually means it's a loopback or test traffic. But since it's being flagged as a potential attack, maybe it's just part of a larger issue. The protocol is ICMP, which is common for ping requests, but a high volume can be suspicious. The data volume is 532 bytes over 4 packets, which doesn't seem too bad on its own, but the duration is very shortâ€”less than half a second. That makes me think it's not just normal traffic but something more targeted.\n\nThe detection mentions \"udpscan\" as the attack type and flags RST. UDP scans typically involve sending many pings or other ICMP messages quickly to probe the network. This can be a precursor to a DDoS attack because it maps out which hosts are reachable and where resources might be weak points.\n\nLooking at the analyses provided, two of them are about ICMP floods, each with similar details: 50k packets per second, 1472-byte payloads, leading to 85% bandwidth and 400ms latency. The third analysis also talks about the same, so there's consistency here.\n\nGiven that the risk score is high at 85 and the threat level is HIGH, the immediate actions should address mitigating the ICMP flood. Rate limiting ICMP traffic would help reduce the volume, blocking the source network would prevent further attacks, and alerting the NOC ensures visibility and response.\n\nInvestigation steps should start with monitoring the traffic to confirm the attack type, then identifying the exact sources using tools like traffic analysis or packet capture. Once the sources are found, working with upstream providers to mitigate their side is crucial.\n\nPrevention measures need to be multi-layered. Enhancing firewalls to drop malicious ICMP traffic, implementing ingress rate limits, and using traffic shaping to control bandwidth. Additionally, educating users about the signs of such attacks and regularly updating security protocols can help prevent future incidents.\n\nThe technical analysis should tie everything together, explaining how the short duration and high volume indicate a scanning attack, possibly leading to a DDoS if not addressed. The RST flag suggests some packets are being reset, which fits with probing behavior.\n\nI need to make sure all these elements are encapsulated into the required JSON structure without adding any extra text. Each key must be filled accurately based on the analysis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"threat_level\": \"HIGH\",\n  \"risk_score\": 85,\n  \"attack_vector\": \"High volume ICMP echo requests indicative of a DDoS prepulse or active network scanning.\",\n  \"potential_impact\": \"Network congestion leading to degraded performance, increased latency, and possible service unavailability.\",\n  \"immediate_actions\": [\n    \"Rate limit ICMP traffic to 10 packets per second at network boundaries.\",\n    \"Block the source network(s) identified as the origin of the attack until investigation completes.\",\n    \"Alert the Network Operations Center (NOC) and escalate the incident.\"\n  ],\n  \"investigation_steps\": [\n    \"Monitor the traffic for patterns consistent with DDoS preparation, such as simultaneous multiple probes across different ports.\",\n    \"Identify the specific sources of the ICMP traffic using traffic analysis tools or packet captures.\",\n    \"Trace the origin of the traffic back to its source network to determine if it's coming from a known botnet or malicious actor.\"\n  ],\n  \"prevention_measures\": [\n    \"Deploy stateful DDoS protection solutions capable of identifying and mitigating ICMP-based attacks.\",\n    \"Collaborate with upstream internet service providers to filter out malicious traffic originating from the attacking networks.\",\n    \"Implement multi-layered defense mechanisms, including intrusion prevention systems (IPS) optimized for ICMP traffic.\"\n  ],\n  \"technical_analysis\": \"The observed network flow exhibits characteristics of a potential DDoS preparation phase.
