  "full_response": "Alright, let's analyze the network flow provided. \n\nFirst, the source IP is listed as 0, which suggests it might be a loopback address or a private IP. However, since the destination is 10.0.0.50, which is another private IP, this could mean it's within a local network, possibly indicating a misconfiguration or a scan from inside the network. \n\nThe port numbers are 12345 for the source and 22 for the destination. Port 22 is typically associated with SSH traffic, often used for remote access. The protocol is TCP, and the flags show a SYN flag, which is common in initial connection attempts. The attack type detected is'synscan', and the confidence level is 0.85, which is quite high.\n\nA synscan attack is a type of vulnerability scanner that attempts to identify open ports by sendingSYN packets to various ports. This can be part of a larger scanning operation or an attempt to probe for weaknesses. Given that the source is within the same subnet as the destination, it might indicate that someone inside the network is conducting such a scan, possibly to find accessible services or vulnerabilities.\n\nConsidering the potential impact, if this is a scan, it could be probing for open ports leading to potential exploitation vectors. If the system isn't properly secured, an attacker might use this information to exploit weak configurations or unpatched systems.\n\nImmediate actions should include isolating the affected systems, blocking internal traffic if necessary, and conducting a thorough security audit to identify and patch any exposed vulnerabilities.\n\nInvestigation steps would involve checking if the source is indeed within the same subnet as the destination, analyzing the traffic pattern to see if there's a pattern of scans or specific targeting, and identifying which systems are responding to these scans.\n\nPrevention measures would include tightening network segmentation, enforcing strict firewall rules to block such scans from being made internally, and implementing regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.\n\nIn terms of technical analysis, the synscan attack is indicative of a probing activity. Since the source is a loopback or private IP, it's likely a legitimate internal host. However, if this traffic is unexpected or unauthorized, it could signal insider threat activity or a misconfiguration.\n\nOverall, while the threat level is moderate based on the detection confidence, the potential impact could range from informational to full system compromise depending on the underlying configurations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"threat_level\": \"HIGH\",\n  \"risk_score\": 85,\n  \"attack_vector\": \"A synscan attack, which involves probing multiple ports to identify open services, was detected from an internal source IP (0.0.0.0).
