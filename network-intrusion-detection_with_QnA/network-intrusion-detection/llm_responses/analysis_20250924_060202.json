  "full_response": "Alright, let's break down the situation. The network flow shows that there's a high volume of UDP traffic from IP address :0 to another system, specifically using the HTTP flood attack vector. Since the source and destination IPs are both set to :0, it suggests that either the source is misconfigured or it's under reflective or amplification attack. Given that it's an HTTP flood, the impact could be significant if not addressed quickly because such attacks can overwhelm servers, leading to downtime, service interruptions, and potential data loss.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the exact nature of the attack. Since the protocol is UDP, it's stateless, making it harder to track the session. This makes amplification attacks more plausible since the attacker can easily exploit the lack of state tracking to flood the destination with a large number of packets.\n\nImmediate actions should focus on mitigating the current attack while preserving services. DDoS mitigation solutions like cloud-based scrubbing services or dedicated appliances can help absorb the traffic. Additionally, monitoring and filtering rules need to be adjusted to block known bad actors or IPs involved in the attack.\n\nInvestigative steps should trace back the origin of the traffic. Since the source IP is :0, we need to determine if it's a legitimate address or if it's part of a reflection attack. Checking upstream networks for any anomalies or elevated traffic patterns can reveal if a third-party network is being used as a launch pad for the attack.\n\nPrevention measures would involve hardening the infrastructure against common DDoS vectors. This includes implementing layered defense mechanisms, upgrading to DDoS-resistant protocols when possible, and maintaining regular traffic analysis to detect unusual patterns early.\n\nThe technical analysis indicates that the attack is likely leveraging the lack of state in UDP to flood the target with packets. With the HTTP flood detection confidence at 0.00, it might indicate that the detection mechanism hasn't been fully tuned yet, suggesting that the actual threat may be higher than reported.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the threat level is HIGH due to the potential to disrupt critical services. Immediate actions must be taken to mitigate the ongoing attack while thorough investigations into the source and configuration issues are conducted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"threat_level\": \"HIGH\",\n  \"risk_score\": 85,\n  \"attack_vector\": \"High-volume UDP traffic indicative of a HTTP flood attack, potentially overwhelming downstream resources.\",\n  \"potential_impact\": \"Service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential data loss depending on the targeted systems.\",\n  \"immediate_actions\": [\n    \"Deploy DDoS mitigation tools to offload traffic\",\n    \"Review and update firewall rules to block malicious IPs\",\n    \"Monitor and analyze traffic patterns for signs of further attacks\"\n  ],\n  \"investigation_steps\": [\n    \"Trace the origin of the traffic to identify the source IP\",\n    \"Check for any upstream network anomalies\",\n    \"Review historical traffic logs for similar patterns\"\n  ],\n  \"prevention_measures\": [\n    \"Implement layered DDoS defense mechanisms\",\n    \"Consider switching to TCP if possible for better state management\",\n    \"Regularly conduct traffic analysis to identify emerging threats\"\n  ],\n  \"technical_analysis\": \"The observed traffic pattern suggests a potential HTTP flood attack leveraging the statelessness of UDP.
